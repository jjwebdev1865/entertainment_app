    review: `Season One is awesome. This builds off the legend of shoresy that was built throughout the Letterkenny TV show.
      The way they describe him in the first 5 minutes of the opening episode pulls fans in right away.
      His relationship with the GM is great cause it shows that while he is difficult to deal with, people are drawn to him.
      Goody, Dolo, Hitch, Micheals, and Sanguinet make a great supporting cast and really help develop the show.
      Also.... the Jim's, enough said.
      Also... Shoresy and Laura Moore.
      I give season one a 9 out of 10 with the only part being the JJ Frankie JJ cheating part, didn't need to happen.

    review: `Season Two builds off of the first one well. The team is winning and the guys are playing great.
      I think in this season Shoresy is again hilarious with Laura Moore.
      The addition of Jory and Liam as more of filler is hilarious as well as bringing in an american team that brings it to Shoresy as well.
      The Jims continue to be great and Sanguinet and Shorey both continue to develop as leaders.
      The only part I found odd was the unnecessary amount of "nudity" in this season. I watched this with my parents and it wasn't needed.
      I get that the boys are local celebrities and probably are pulling game, but less show and more plant the idea would improve the show.

    review: `This show continues to get better with each season. The cast chemistry continues to grow and get better.
      The only thing you can't beat is time, and that is what this season is about. If you play contact sports, you're going to get hurt.
      The interesting thing for me was the lack of Laura Moore scenes especially that they are are dating now.
      I will say, the parts shes in are pretty good. This show always gets me back on a fitness mindset. Go til you can't go no more.
      Great show for any hockey fan, comedy fan, or someone just looking for a good laugh!
