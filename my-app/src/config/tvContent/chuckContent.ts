    review: `
      My family grew up watching this show and I wanted to rewatch it.
      Zachary Levi (Chuck) and Joshua Gomez (Morgan) make a great best friend combo and how Morgan trusts Chuck shows a great friendship.
      Captain Awesome and Jeff are my favorite characters just due to humor and breaking the rom com expectations of the show.
      Sarah and Chuck are always interesting to me because I have always felt like the show waited too long to get to the connection part.
      Some of the moments in this season are great, like Chuck being a nerd and Casey being a badass.
      Some confuse me, like morgan almost getting fired and the constant bad timing of Bryce Larkin (its almost predictable to see him).
