    review: `It was not terrible. The naiveness of the vaulters was solid. The hardship of the outside world was good too.
      Walter Goggins took the show, he was awesome and he fit is casting type. Maximus was poorly portrayed, John Bodega would have been better.
      Anytime I see a trans actor i crack up and give a good chuckle for DEI casting. 
      Dane was a pathetic character and in real life wouldn't scare shit.
