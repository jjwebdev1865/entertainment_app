    review: `Nathan Fillion is the goat across all seasons of this show. 
      His character shows why its important to find someone who keeps you young.
      The connection between Kate and Castle is shown right away and i love how they have her be a big fan of his books in this season.
      Espisito and Ryan are two of the best side characters in any show, plus Martha Rogers cracks me up as a mother Castle can't control.
      I like how Castle shows Beckett how to let loose and have fun, especially since its a key thing throughout the series.

    review: `Nathan Fillion is the goat across all seasons of this show. Its great how Castle and Beckett finally start a relationship here.
      Some shows do this very poorly but I have always felt this is one of the better connections. 
      They show the struggles of a work relationship and how Alexis and Martha adapt to the relationship.
