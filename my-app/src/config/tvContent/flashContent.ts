    review: `THe main group, team Flash, of Dr. Snow, Cisco, Dr. Wells, and Barry Allen is awesome. 
      Throw in Joe West as the protective father, just awesome.
      The Reverse flash was a great villian, the way he was connected to Eddie Thawne (Spoiler) was a interesting twist.
      I will saw Barry's obsession with Iris was interesting as well as the connection to Eddie Thawne. 
      I give this a good 9 out of 10 for season one. The good moments were cool and the CGI for speed was pretty good.
      Similar to Smallville, I like how they are discovering his powers and all shocked when he does something new.
