    review: `Probably, like most shows, the best season is season one so far.
      Lauren Grahams (Sarah) family shows what its like being raised by a wild child. Its usually not glamourous.
      I'm glad they didnt make her some successful person, because todays culture glamorize that lifestyle when most of it is fake.
      I relate to Peter Krause (Adam) the most, the guy that people rely on but who never goes to anyone else for help, just figures it out.
      Erika Christensen (Julia) is also relateable because shes dealing with a lot but continues to help where she can and wants to be involved.
      The kids in this show do a great job, while i do think that Haddie and Amber get annoying at points.

    review: `The season finale here is odd to be honest. Also Haddie is extremely annoying in this season.
      I like the Micheal B. Jordan character a lot at first cause he is honorable, after that he sucks.
      Dak Shepards (Crosby) screws up and keeps screwing up and expects people to pull him out, not himself.
      If I was the grandparents, I would have a tighter leash on Sarah, like you're living at home at 40, grow up.
      Also Adam losing his cool goes against everything his character stands for, 
      I was suprised by that one even though his new boss is a dumbass.
      Rest of the show is pretty normal. Drew wants a father figure and still kind of leans on Adam.
      Max shows the audience the struggles of having a special needs child.
      Continues to be a good, realistic show.
