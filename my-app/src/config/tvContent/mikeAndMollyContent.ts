    review: `
      My Brother and I decided to watch this hungover one morning after hulu recommended it after us watching Chuck.
      The jokes in this show are top notch. Literally had me and my brother laughing our asses off at the Grandma and Carl.
      The show is obviously a comedy about Mike and Molly but the supporting cast is amazing.
      Vince is one of a kind, Carl gives and takes incredible humor, and Victoria (the sister) is comical with her stupidy and love for pot.
      I give season 1 a 10 out of 10. One of the best seasons on a tv show I have seen in a long time!
