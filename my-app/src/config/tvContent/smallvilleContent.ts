    review: `This was one of the best seasons. This show was to show the making of superman and thats exactly what it did. 
      Clark discovers many abilities during this season and the show takes on the approach of Martha and Jon Kent teaching him.
      The high school outcast is exactly what he would be and having friends like Chloe and Pete help develop his character.
      The shows concept of Clark and Lex Luthor being friends to start is definitely one of my favorite elements of the show.
      It shows Lex's intrigue into everything and his thirst for knowledge, but how he can't understand Clark.

    review: `Best thing about this season is the introduction of Lois Lane. I will say this was a good transition to introduce her as Chloe's cousin.
      I'm also a huge Supernatural fan so Jensen Ackles is one of my favorite TV actors and his role as the Jason Teague is a great cast. 
      The only odd thing about the cast of Jensen is he is a college graduate who gets into a romantic relationship with a high school student.
      One thing about this season i like is that Clark gets feeling for Alicia. It shows he loves Lana but like all high school boys, has multiple high school crushes.
      The introduction of Bart Allen is another great season that shows Clark would be open to the concept of working with other people with powers.
