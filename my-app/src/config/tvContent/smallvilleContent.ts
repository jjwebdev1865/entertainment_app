    review: `This was one of the best seasons. This show was to show the making of superman and thats exactly what it did. 
      Clark discovers many abilities during this season and the show takes on the approach of Martha and Jon Kent teaching him.
      The high school outcast is exactly what he would be and having friends like Chloe and Pete help develop his character.
      The shows concept of Clark and Lex Luthor being friends to start is definitely one of my favorite elements of the show.
      It shows Lex's intrigue into everything and his thirst for knowledge, but how he can't understand Clark.
