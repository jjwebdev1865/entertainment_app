  Glen Powell is now one of the biggest male leads in Hollywood. He is taking over.
  Of the movies I have reviewed, his first lead role was in Set It Up where he played a ego driven assistant looking for a promotion.
  He showed how people can change as he starts to see through the crap in his life and grow.
  I think this led perfectly for him to be a big name in Rom Coms as Ben in Anyone But You. 
  A defensive guy who avoids being hurt but as he learns more, is open to change and looks to take the big leap, his "Moving Train".

  Robbie Amell, in my opinion, is a strong secondary actor and not quite the lead.
  His support in the Flash was great, as he played a cool character but it made sense why he was seen more as a sporadic character.
  His lead in Code 8 series on Netflix isn't bad, but he doesn't stand out the way leads like Glen Powell or Miles Teller do.

  While Justin Hartley is my favorite Green Arrow, I think that Stephen Amell brought a different perspective to the character.
  He is someone who comes back from the island in Season 1 with a mission but also a past of struggles and conflictions.
  His acting was great as he was someone with a stone cold face who prioritized the mission over everything.
  I think Amell did a great job throughout the show of growing as the people around him changed his priorities in life while also having his back.
  In Code 8 series, he continued to show why he can be a lead actor. 
  He does a great job of showing his abilities and once again putting the objective first.

  Really Like Xolo's cast as Blue Beetle and he led the way and is the main reason I like the show.
  He does a great job of not knowing what to expect and learning how to handle the sacred beetle.
  I like how he has his character gain more confidence throughout the movie.
  I am looking forward to seeing him as the lead in more movies. 
  I can see a similar career path as someone like Tom Holland or Glen Powell.
