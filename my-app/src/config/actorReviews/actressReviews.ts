  The only thing I have seen her in is Blue Beetle and I am curious where her career goes.
  I think she is a very solid actress and I know that the box office wasn't friendly to Blue Beetle.
  She portrayed Jenny Kord well and also played kind of a bad ass who accepted her path as her fathers heir.
  She seems to have a similar style as Zendaya and could very well take off, especially with a cast in the DC universe.

  Sydney Sweeney came on the radar for me starting with Anyone But You. 
  She played a great role in the fact that she was some struggling with a lot of internal battles.
  I will say I think she is better fit for Rom Coms then superhero movies because she was cast as a teenager in Madame Web.
  She did not excel and the movie was a box office flop.
