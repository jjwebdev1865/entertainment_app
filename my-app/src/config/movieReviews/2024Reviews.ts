export const anyoneButYouReview = `The first non hallmark Romantic Comedy to peak my interest. 
  Their was a alot of hype around this film due to the connection between Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney.
  The two showed a lot of on screen chemistry and played the hatred part well at the beginning.
  What really won this one for me was the way the two seemed to soften up toward each other and become more open as they understood each other better.
  The soundtrack for this movie was also amazing, the Spins is one of my favorite songs and the Unwritten scenes were hilarious.
  I gave this a 8/10 for the plot line and the realism in which people date in the modern dating field!`;

export const aquamanTwoReview = `Its been awhile since I have seen the movie as I write this review. I thought the first aquaman was awesome.
  Jason Momoa having a connection to my home state of Iowa also motivates me to see his movies. The drama around the Depp/Heard trial played a role in this film.
  Amber Heard plays Mera and her role was reduced quite a bit due to fans displeasure with her.
  I did really like Orms role in this, he was given a redemption arc, which is similar to the comics and cartoons (he struggles with this arc due to his desire for power).
  The plot was weak, CGI sucked, and had a lot of terribly forced humor that lead to awkward scenes which is why i have this a 3/10.

export const duneReview = `This movie was a good start to a series. It did a good job explaining things to the audience and explained relationships to the crowd.
  Timothée Chalamet did a great job leading this star studded cast. Even Jason Momoa, whose character plays a small role in this file, helped support Paul Atreides.
  Oscar Isaac's did a good job of portraying the father, I have read only the first book but his father was supposed to be focused on the future.
  I gave this an 8/10 because the movie was really good and they got through a lot of content however sometimes it seemed like the movie just dragged on.

export const duneTwoReview = `This movie was fucking awesome. Bringing in Zendaya's character Chani as a big part of the franchise was big.
  I was suprised when Austin Butler was casted as a badass and Dave Bautista was supposed to play a coward but both played their roles to perfection.
  The only critique i have was that Dave Bautista's character was really hard to understand at some times and Austin Butlers character Fedy-Rautha's sexual pets were weird.
  I gave this a 9/10 because the plot was awesome, Paul Atreides accepted his destiny but showed his struggle to get there. 
  I think that the sand worm riding part was extremely cool CGI as well as fight scene where they attack the Harkonnens.

export const theLibrarianSpearReview = `This is one of my favorite movie trilogies out there. It became a fan cult that lead to a tv show.
  The main character Flynn Carsen (played by Noah Wyle) is perfectly cast and played to perfection. 
  His curiosity is what I would expect out of someone whose goal is to acquire knowledge, plus I am a dork and respect his mindset.
  Judson and Charlene are great support characters who play a great role as the administrator and keeper of the Librarian.
  The plot line is fantasy but i like how they incorporate small things into the plot to keep fans going.
  This movie gets a 7/10 from me because the acting is great but the CGI is terrible, the villians are weak, and could use with better music.

export const theLibrarianSolomonsMinesReview = `TODO: rewatch. cant remember too much about this one`;

export const theLibrarianJudasReview = `First thing I want to say is that I am a huge fan of Stana Katic due to her role in the show Castle.
  With that being said, Noah Wyle and Bob Newhart carried this cast as the villian character was weak.
  I get that this series is a fantasy series but this series always gave me Indiana Jones vibes so the introduction of vampires is weak.
  Flynn Carsens desire to learn and grow is great, also i love that he showed up to New Orleans in a white tuxedo from the 50s (CLASS!).
  I have this a 6/10 due to the vampire plot line, Flynns mopiness about getting dumped, and Stana Katic's bad accent.
  I still enjoy this concept and love Excalibur!

export const rebelMoonPartOneReview = `This movie had a stellar supporting cast. Charlie Hunnam is one of my favorite actors. 
  Anytime you see Djimon Hounsou, you know the movie is going to be good and he is going to play a hardass. 
  Ed Skrein plays a great villian and I see him playing more villian roles, he has the look and demeanor for it.
  Now to the main character, Kora was played well but i just never truly felt intimidated by her despite the movie explaining her background.
  The fight scenes with her were sick though! I would have prefered less slow motion takes but still had cool scenes.
  This movie gets a 5/10 from due to the PC issues I saw which were mainly around the villians all being white, even in support. 
  Also Kora was really hard to understand. The saving grace for this film was Djimon Hounsou, Ed Skrein, and Charlie Hunnam.

export const rickyStanickyReview = `I honestly expected this to be complete dog shit. I was suprised by how much i liked the ending.
  The plot is alright and John Cena's characters main source of income is very odd, probably could have done better with that.
  The reason i gave this a 5 is mostly due the ending. This comedy has its moments but for the most part its cheap humor.
  How the wives start to catch one is pretty good too, the actresses facial expressions know that the fellas are full of shit.
  One thing i will say is that the 3 friends do show one thing about todays society, its hard to meet friends or join a group when you get older.

export const roadhouseReview = `TODO: rewatch. cant remember much besides the villian sucked, Gyllanhall was fucking awesome. and McGregor just played himself`;

export const wonkaReview = `I actually wasn't supposed to see this film. I was going to see another movie and the projector broke so I was given a ticket to Wonka.
  I did not expect it to be a musical but actually liked that part of the movie. The CGI was pretty good too, childish for a reason.
  Keegan-Michael Key played a great role and was hilarious (as always) at it. How he steadily gained weight cracked me up. It was a good addition.
  The currency of chocolate was a little odd to be honest but i guess that part of the story. The umpa lumpa addition and back story was pretty good.
  This was my first time seeing Timothée Chalamet lead a movie and I was impressed. I can tell he is going to go far in Hollywood.
