# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Key Libraries for Growth

Using this for the first time to learn how the interaction between clicking an image can open a modal
I also used this as a way to learn accessibility best practices and how to properly add aria tags

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
